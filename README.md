# Arithmetic Expressions in Python:
# Multiplication and Addition
result_multiply = (3 * 4) + 5
print("Result of multiplication then addition:", result_multiply)

# Conversion of Minutes to Hours
total_minutes = 200
minutes_in_an_hour = 60
hours = total_minutes / minutes_in_an_hour
print("Conversion of 200 minutes to hours:", hours)
